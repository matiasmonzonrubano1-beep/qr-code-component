## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a box item with a background image, using display grid instead of flex and sizes and position arguments.

### Continued development

I am still a begginer so I have much to learn, but I am definitively interested in learning more about html sites.

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me a ton with formatting and css objects. I have been using it and will probably continue to use it for a long while.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - I've found that for every problem I run into while programming, no matter the language or project, there's always a thread with the answer that I'm looking for.
